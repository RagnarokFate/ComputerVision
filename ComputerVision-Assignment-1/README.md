# Computer Vision Assignment 1 - Hough Transform on ellipses

The goal is to solve a number of planar puzzles, as much as possible. Each puzzle has a certain number of parts that are square-shaped and connect after warp operations that are not given to a single mosaic if there are overlaps between the parts. The different puzzles are distinguished by the following parameters (which also affect the difficulty levels):
1. Total number of parts
2. Type of transformation (warping) possible: homography/affine
3. Level of distortion of the transformations (how far the resulting quadrilateral is from being a square of the same size)
4. Photometric distortions of the images (so that corresponding pixels between images are not necessarily of the same color).
