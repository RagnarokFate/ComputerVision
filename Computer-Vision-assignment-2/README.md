# Computer Vision Assignment 2 - Photometric Stereo based View Synthesis

The goal is to create a new sequence of viewing angles of a scene that links a pair of rectified images. This can be done by changing the pose of the camera and synthesizing the image that was acquired from the new shooting angle. In each example, there is a pair of rectified images that were captured by an identical pair of cameras (with the same intrinsics) when the distance between the cameras (baseline) is 10 cm (0.1 meters).
