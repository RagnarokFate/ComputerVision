# COMPUTER VISION

This is a full course assignments of Computer Vision in Computer Science i took in 2023! it consists from 3 different assignments:
1. Hough Transform on ellipses
2. Photometric Stereo based View Synthesis
3. Logistic regression for multi-class classification

VIDEO : COMING SOON!

### Assignment 1 : 
> RANSAC Puzzle Solver. I used the RANSAC algorithm to create a solver that accurately arranges a set of images into a complete puzzle. Before stitching, I developed a method to calculate each image's correct position. The resulting solver assembles the images effectively.

### Assignment 2: 
>Depth and Disparity Maps Calculation In this assignment, I focused on computing depth and disparity maps from stereo images. By applying algorithms to a pair of stereo images, I generated a depth map conveying object distances from the camera and a disparity map highlighting horizontal pixel coordinate differences between left and right images. I also created ten synthetic images along the X-axis between the originals to improve depth perception understanding.

### Assignment 3:
> MNIST Neural Network Digit Classifier Assignment 3 involved creating a digit classifier using a neural network for the MNIST dataset. The goal was accurate classification of handwritten digits, achieving over 90% accuracy and demonstrating the model's effectiveness.



**Each project has it's own properities and decoders/assistant function implemented in Python.**
